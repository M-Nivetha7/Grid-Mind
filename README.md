# Grid-Mind
GridMind is a Pygame-based traffic intersection simulator that balances two directions of traffic using an adaptive signal controller. It observes how many vehicles are waiting on each side and switches phases to reduce queue lengths while preventing starvation, providing a simple visual testbed for smarter traffic-control logic.
