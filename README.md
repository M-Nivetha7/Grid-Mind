## 🚦 About GridMind

GridMind is a **Pygame based** traffic intersection simulator. It dynamically manages traffic signals based on queue lengths. Its goal is to keep vehicles moving smoothly:

* Smart decision making based on real time vehicle count  
* Prevents one side from waiting too long  
* Simple visual playground to test better traffic management control logic  

---

## 🎯 Features

✔ Adaptive traffic signal switching  
✔ Queue length monitoring  
✔ Starvation prevention logic  
✔ Real time visual simulation  
✔ Base platform for reinforcement learning improvements  

---

## 🛠 Future Add ons

* More lanes with complex intersections  
* Pedestrian signal control  
* Q learning or deep RL integration  
* SUMO map import support
